### 2025-08-10 - Project Setup & Challenge Analysis

**Context**: Starting Rinha de Backend 2025 challenge with Elixir
**Action**: Analyzed challenge requirements, configured CLAUDE.md memory, created Phoenix project structure
**Learning**: Challenge requires payment processor intermediary with intelligent routing between default/fallback processors

### 2025-08-10 - Core Architecture Implementation
**Context**: Building payment processor routing system with health monitoring
**Action**: Implemented Finch HTTP client, ProcessorMonitor GenServer, PaymentRouter logic, and database schema
**Learning**: OTP supervision trees with Finch for connection pooling, GenServer for stateful health checks, pattern matching for routing logic

### 2025-08-10 - API Endpoints & Production Setup
**Context**: Completing challenge requirements with REST API and deployment setup
**Action**: Built POST /payments and GET /payments-summary endpoints, Payment schema/context, Docker Compose with Nginx load balancing
**Learning**: Phoenix controllers with proper validation, Ecto contexts for business logic, Docker multi-service orchestration with resource constraints

### 2025-08-10 - Local Testing Setup & Docker Troubleshooting
**Context**: Setting up local testing environment with challenge payment processors
**Action**: Configured payment processor URLs (8001/8002), set up challenge services with ARM64 compatibility, fixed memory allocation issues (110MB per API instance)
**Learning**: Docker platform compatibility (AMD64 vs ARM64), container memory limits and OOM kills (exit code 137), resource allocation within challenge constraints

### 2025-08-10 - Challenge Integration & Multi-stage Docker
**Context**: Fixing API compliance issues and performance problems with runtime compilation
**Action**: Updated processor URLs to correct hostnames, fixed API response formats, implemented multi-stage Docker build with Elixir releases, added network connectivity to payment processors
**Learning**: Challenge-specific API requirements, multi-stage Docker builds for performance (compile vs runtime), Elixir releases for production deployment

### 2025-08-10 - Performance Optimization & Load Testing
**Context**: Improving from 17% success rate and 10s response times to high-performance system
**Action**: Optimized Nginx config with keepalive, async database writes, improved connection pooling, database indexes, reduced health check frequency
**Learning**: Phoenix/Bandit configuration constraints, async processing patterns in Elixir, Nginx optimization for high-concurrency load balancing

### 2025-08-10 - Advanced Performance Optimizations
**Context**: Further optimization to reduce p99 from 1.5s to under 1.25s for performance bonus and compete with $380K leader
**Action**: Removed duplicate correlation ID checking, implemented HTTP connection pooling with Finch (50 conns per processor), added keepalive/nodelay TCP options, made health checks async and less frequent (30s)
**Learning**: Database reads are major bottleneck for latency, Finch connection pooling configuration, async health monitoring patterns, TCP optimization for HTTP clients

### 2025-08-10 - Payments Inconsistency Fix
**Context**: 5068 payments inconsistencies causing test failures, 64.5% failure rate with database-first approach
**Action**: Implemented fast in-memory deduplication using ETS table, restored async DB writes for performance, GenServer-based deduplication cache with atomic check-and-mark
**Learning**: Database-first consistency creates massive performance bottleneck (4s+ response times), ETS provides microsecond-level atomic operations, in-memory deduplication preserves both consistency and performance

### 2025-08-11 - Consistency & Timestamp Synchronization Attempts
**Context**: Exploring different consistency approaches and timestamp synchronization between DB and processors
**Action**: Experimented with database-first approach (pre-insert payments), sync vs async DB operations, fixed schema/migration mismatches (UUID primary keys), identified timestamp inconsistencies between local and processor times
**Learning**: Multi-stage consistency approaches create more bottlenecks, schema/migration alignment critical for proper UUID handling, processor timestamp synchronization needed for accurate summary filtering
