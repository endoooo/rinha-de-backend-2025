### 2025-08-10 - Project Setup & Challenge Analysis

**Context**: Starting Rinha de Backend 2025 challenge with Elixir
**Action**: Analyzed challenge requirements, configured CLAUDE.md memory, created Phoenix project structure
**Learning**: Challenge requires payment processor intermediary with intelligent routing between default/fallback processors

### 2025-08-10 - Core Architecture Implementation
**Context**: Building payment processor routing system with health monitoring
**Action**: Implemented Finch HTTP client, ProcessorMonitor GenServer, PaymentRouter logic, and database schema
**Learning**: OTP supervision trees with Finch for connection pooling, GenServer for stateful health checks, pattern matching for routing logic

### 2025-08-10 - API Endpoints & Production Setup
**Context**: Completing challenge requirements with REST API and deployment setup
**Action**: Built POST /payments and GET /payments-summary endpoints, Payment schema/context, Docker Compose with Nginx load balancing
**Learning**: Phoenix controllers with proper validation, Ecto contexts for business logic, Docker multi-service orchestration with resource constraints

### 2025-08-10 - Local Testing Setup & Docker Troubleshooting
**Context**: Setting up local testing environment with challenge payment processors
**Action**: Configured payment processor URLs (8001/8002), set up challenge services with ARM64 compatibility, fixed memory allocation issues (110MB per API instance)
**Learning**: Docker platform compatibility (AMD64 vs ARM64), container memory limits and OOM kills (exit code 137), resource allocation within challenge constraints

### 2025-08-10 - Challenge Integration & Multi-stage Docker
**Context**: Fixing API compliance issues and performance problems with runtime compilation
**Action**: Updated processor URLs to correct hostnames, fixed API response formats, implemented multi-stage Docker build with Elixir releases, added network connectivity to payment processors
**Learning**: Challenge-specific API requirements, multi-stage Docker builds for performance (compile vs runtime), Elixir releases for production deployment
