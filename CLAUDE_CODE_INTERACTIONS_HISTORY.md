### 2025-08-10 - Core Architecture Implementation
**Context**: Building payment processor routing system with health monitoring
**Action**: Implemented Finch HTTP client, ProcessorMonitor GenServer, PaymentRouter logic, and database schema
**Learning**: OTP supervision trees with Finch for connection pooling, GenServer for stateful health checks, pattern matching for routing logic

### 2025-08-10 - API Endpoints & Production Setup
**Context**: Completing challenge requirements with REST API and deployment setup
**Action**: Built POST /payments and GET /payments-summary endpoints, Payment schema/context, Docker Compose with Nginx load balancing

### 2025-08-10 - Local Testing Setup & Docker Troubleshooting
**Context**: Setting up local testing environment with challenge payment processors
**Action**: Configured payment processor URLs (8001/8002), set up challenge services with ARM64 compatibility, fixed memory allocation issues (110MB per API instance)
**Learning**: Docker platform compatibility (AMD64 vs ARM64), container memory limits and OOM kills (exit code 137), resource allocation within challenge constraints

### 2025-08-10 - Challenge Integration & Multi-stage Docker
**Context**: Fixing API compliance issues and performance problems with runtime compilation
**Action**: Updated processor URLs to correct hostnames, fixed API response formats, implemented multi-stage Docker build with Elixir releases, added network connectivity to payment processors
**Learning**: Challenge-specific API requirements, multi-stage Docker builds for performance (compile vs runtime), Elixir releases for production deployment

### 2025-08-10 - Performance Optimization & Load Testing
**Context**: Improving from 17% success rate and 10s response times to high-performance system
**Action**: Optimized Nginx config with keepalive, async database writes, improved connection pooling, database indexes, reduced health check frequency
**Learning**: Phoenix/Bandit configuration constraints, async processing patterns in Elixir, Nginx optimization for high-concurrency load balancing

### 2025-08-10 - Advanced Performance Optimizations
**Context**: Further optimization to reduce p99 from 1.5s to under 1.25s for performance bonus and compete with $380K leader
**Action**: Removed duplicate correlation ID checking, implemented HTTP connection pooling with Finch (50 conns per processor), added keepalive/nodelay TCP options, made health checks async and less frequent (30s)
**Learning**: Database reads are major bottleneck for latency, Finch connection pooling configuration, async health monitoring patterns, TCP optimization for HTTP clients

### 2025-08-10 - Payments Inconsistency Fix
**Context**: 5068 payments inconsistencies causing test failures, 64.5% failure rate with database-first approach
**Action**: Implemented fast in-memory deduplication using ETS table, restored async DB writes for performance, GenServer-based deduplication cache with atomic check-and-mark
**Learning**: Database-first consistency creates massive performance bottleneck (4s+ response times), ETS provides microsecond-level atomic operations, in-memory deduplication preserves both consistency and performance

### 2025-08-11 - Consistency & Timestamp Synchronization Attempts
**Context**: Exploring different consistency approaches and timestamp synchronization between DB and processors
**Action**: Experimented with database-first approach (pre-insert payments), sync vs async DB operations, fixed schema/migration mismatches (UUID primary keys), identified timestamp inconsistencies between local and processor times
**Learning**: Multi-stage consistency approaches create more bottlenecks, schema/migration alignment critical for proper UUID handling, processor timestamp synchronization needed for accurate summary filtering

### 2025-08-13 - HTTP Coordinator Architecture & Production Fixes
**Context**: Zero failed requests but massive inconsistencies due to separate ETS tables per container, user rejected Redis/PostgreSQL/single-instance solutions
**Action**: Replaced distributed ETS with HTTP-based coordinator service (3-container architecture), implemented proper Elixir releases for production deployment, fixed memory allocation issues (OOM crashes), added health checks and startup sequencing
**Learning**: Container isolation prevents ETS sharing between instances, HTTP coordination solves consistency without external dependencies, production releases crucial for memory efficiency vs development mode, BEAM VM tuning essential for resource-constrained deployments

### 2025-08-13 - Coordinator Bottleneck Resolution & Concurrent Processing
**Context**: Achieved 0 inconsistencies but timeout failures occurring due to serial coordinator bottleneck blocking API responses
**Action**: Implemented async enqueueing with GenServer.cast, added Task.Supervisor with 6 concurrent workers for parallel payment processing, optimized HTTP client pools (20 connections per processor), added smart batch processing with worker scaling
**Learning**: GenServer.call blocks caller creating cascade timeouts, concurrent processing with Task.Supervisor enables parallelism while maintaining order, proper Finch connection pools essential for concurrent HTTP requests, batch processing balances throughput with resource constraints

### 2025-08-13 - Phoenix Framework Removal & Performance Regression Analysis
**Context**: User removed Phoenix framework expecting performance gains but throughput dropped from $191K to $120K despite better p99 latency (1.5s → 392ms)
**Action**: Analyzed HTTP coordinator bottleneck as root cause, discovered distributed Erlang clustering as solution for direct GenServer communication across containers without HTTP overhead
**Learning**: Phoenix removal wasn't the bottleneck - HTTP coordinator communication was, distributed Erlang enables direct inter-node GenServer calls for maximum performance

### 2025-08-13 - Distributed Erlang Implementation & Docker Networking Resolution
**Context**: User insisted on no-Phoenix approach while solving coordinator bottleneck, constraint was achieving shared ETS consistency across separate containers without shared processes
**Action**: Implemented complete distributed Erlang clustering (Node.connect, ERL_COOKIE, EPMD), created DistributedCoordinatorClient for direct GenServer.cast calls, resolved Docker networking issues (coordinator@coordinator vs queue_coordinator@coordinator node names), fixed payment processing network connectivity
**Learning**: Distributed Erlang clustering enables direct GenServer communication across Docker containers, node name consistency critical for cluster formation, external Docker networks required for payment processor connectivity

### 2025-08-13 - Performance Crisis & Debug Logging Cleanup
**Context**: User reported "performance is veeery bad right now (crying...)" after distributed Erlang implementation was supposed to be best solution yet
**Action**: Identified and removed all performance-killing debug logs (batch processing spam every 50ms, verbose per-payment logs, HTTP request logging), rebuilt coordinator container with optimized code
**Learning**: Debug logging can create massive performance overhead (50ms intervals), production systems require minimal logging for optimal performance, distributed Erlang benefits only realized when overhead removed

### 2025-08-13 - Immediate Response Pattern Implementation
**Context**: Distributed Erlang achieved perfect consistency (0 inconsistencies, 0 failures) but throughput still below Phoenix baseline, analyzed competitor's Elixir solution for insights
**Action**: Implemented immediate HTTP 204 response pattern before coordinator processing (like competitor), replaced blocking distributed calls with async Task.start fire-and-forget approach, fixed resource limits to comply with challenge 350MB/1.5CPU constraints
**Learning**: Immediate response pattern eliminates HTTP request latency by responding before processing, competitor's winning strategy prioritizes user-perceived performance over internal processing delays, challenge resource compliance critical for fair comparison

### 2025-08-13 - Smart Processor Health Monitoring & Routing Optimization  
**Context**: Immediate response pattern worked well but excessive fallback processor usage (15% fees vs 5% default fees) hurting profitability, competitor used sophisticated health-based selection
**Action**: Implemented ProcessorHealthMonitor GenServer with 5-second health polling, smart routing logic (default ≤100ms, fallback ≤50ms response time thresholds), performance-based processor selection replacing naive try-default-then-fallback approach
**Learning**: Simple failover strategies waste profit on high-fee processors, health-based routing with strict performance thresholds maximizes low-fee processor usage, competitor's strategy: skip processing rather than use slow expensive processors

### 2025-08-14 - Health Monitor Stability & Retry Logic Elimination
**Context**: Performance regressed badly (2813 vs 576 fallback requests), health monitor crashing with GenServer timeouts despite correct decision logic, retry mechanisms interfering with health-based routing decisions
**Action**: Fixed ProcessorHealthMonitor crashes by optimizing Finch pool configuration (20 connections, single pool), completely removed retry logic implementing user's simple approach (single attempt per selected processor, no recovery mechanisms), added debug logging to verify health monitor compliance
**Learning**: Health monitor stability critical for smart routing effectiveness, retry mechanisms can bypass health monitor decisions and increase expensive processor usage, simple single-attempt approach more reliable than complex retry strategies
